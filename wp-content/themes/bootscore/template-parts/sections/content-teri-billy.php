			<h2>Teresa Billy</h2>
			<p>Teresa Billy is the Assistant Director of the Chahta Anumpa Aiikhvna, or the Choctaw School of Language. Teresa is a first language Choctaw speaker, and her main goal is to
				protect the identity of the Choctaw people by preserving their language. According to her, "It is important for each of us, as well as for our future
				generations, to connect us to our mother tongue, which relates us to our rich history, culture and language."</p>

			<p>Teresa's work with Marvel Studios' translators allowed the show to be subtitled in Choctaw, a first for our tribe. Not only can tribal members see the language of their
				ancestors on a major television series, but it will help them realize how important it is to learn their language and use it in their everyday lives.</p>
			<p>Teresa's husband, Curtis Billy, also worked on the Echo project, providing valuable historical information about the game of stickball. Unfortunately, Curtis
				passed away before he could see his contributions on the big screen, but we are so grateful for his involvement.</p>
