			<h2>Choctaw Language</h2>
			<p>One of the most important ways the Choctaw Nation exercises its sovereignty is through its language. For generations, Choctaw people were discouraged or outright
				forbidden to speak their language, and as fluent speakers passed away without handing it down to younger generations, it nearly died out.</p>
			<p>The Choctaw Language is going through a period of revitalization, however. In recent years, the <a href="https://www.choctawnation.com/about/language/" target="_blank">Chahta
					Anumpa Aiikhvna (Choctaw School of Language)</a> has ramped up efforts to increase the number of speakers through the incorporation of
				technology and a wide variety of learning options.</p>
			<p>At each regular meeting, the <a href="https://www.choctawnation.com/about/government/tribal-council/" target="_blank">Tribal Council</a> honors a Choctaw First Language
				Speaker of the Month. These culture keepers hold a cherished place in our tribe.</p>
			<p>Having <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/echo/1" target="_blank">Echo</a> dubbed in Choctaw is an especially significant milestone for the tribe. Teresa
				Billy and other language experts worked diligently with Marvel Studios to ensure the highest level of accuracy in the translation process.</p>
