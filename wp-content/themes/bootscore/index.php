						<p>Native American representation in television and film has a long, not-so-sterling history, but things seem to be changing for the better in recent years. Studios
							have shown interest in reversing some of the damaging and inaccurate stereotypes Native Americans have faced on the big screen. Groundbreaking and award-winning
							shows like Reservation Dogs have blazed a trail for Indigenous inclusion in storytelling, cultural representation, casting, costume design, and much more.</p>
						<p>Marvel Studios' new series, Echo, is an exciting project where Native representation, specifically Choctaw representation, has been placed squarely at the
							forefront of
							creative development. From the beginning, experts in Choctaw history, culture, and language were included in conversations about how Choctaw people would be
							portrayed. This significant step shows Marvel Studios' desire to be part of the future of Native American representation in Hollywood, and the Choctaw Nation is
							proud to
							partner with the studio on this project.</p>

						<h2>Choctaw Language</h2>
						<p>One of the most important ways the Choctaw Nation exercises its sovereignty is through its language. For generations, Choctaw people were discouraged or outright
							forbidden to speak their language, and as fluent speakers passed away without handing it down to younger generations, it nearly died out.</p>
						<p>The Choctaw Language is going through a period of revitalization, however. In recent years, the <a href="https://www.choctawnation.com/about/language/"
							   target="_blank">Chahta Anumpa Aiikhvna (Choctaw School of Language)</a> has ramped up efforts to increase the number of speakers through the incorporation of
							technology and a wide variety of learning options.</p>
						<p>At each regular meeting, the <a href="https://www.choctawnation.com/about/government/tribal-council/" target="_blank">Tribal Council</a> honors a Choctaw First
							Language Speaker of the Month. These culture keepers hold a cherished place in our tribe.</p>
						<p>Having <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/echo/1" target="_blank">Echo</a> dubbed in Choctaw is an especially significant milestone for the tribe. Teresa
							Billy and other language experts worked diligently with Marvel Studios to ensure the highest level of accuracy in the translation process.</p>

						<h2>Teresa Billy</h2>
						<p>Teresa Billy is the Assistant Director of the Chahta Anumpa Aiikhvna, or the Choctaw School of Language. Teresa is a first language Choctaw speaker, and her main
							goal is to protect the identity of the Choctaw people by preserving their language. According to her, "It is important for each of us, as well as for our future
							generations, to connect us to our mother tongue, which relates us to our rich history, culture and language."</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 order-3">
						<p>Teresa's work with Marvel Studios' translators allowed the show to be subtitled in Choctaw, a first for our tribe. Not only can tribal members see the language of
							their
							ancestors on a major television series, but it will help them realize how important it is to learn their language and use it in their everyday lives.</p>
						<p>Teresa's husband, Curtis Billy, also worked on the Echo project, providing valuable historical information about the game of stickball. Unfortunately, Curtis
							passed away before he could see his contributions on the big screen, but we are so grateful for his involvement.</p>
