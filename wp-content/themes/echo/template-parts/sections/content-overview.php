			<p>Native American representation in television and film has a long, not-so-sterling history, but things seem to be changing for the better in recent years. Studios
				have shown interest in reversing some of the damaging and inaccurate stereotypes Native Americans have faced on the big screen. Groundbreaking and award-winning
				shows like Reservation Dogs have blazed a trail for Indigenous inclusion in storytelling, cultural representation, casting, costume design, and much more.</p>
			<p>Marvel Studios' new series, Echo, is an exciting project where Native representation, specifically Choctaw representation, has been placed squarely at the
				forefront of
				creative development. From the beginning, experts in Choctaw history, culture, and language were included in conversations about how Choctaw people would be
				portrayed. This significant step shows Marvel Studios' desire to be part of the future of Native American representation in Hollywood, and the Choctaw Nation is
				proud to
				partner with the studio on this project.</p>
